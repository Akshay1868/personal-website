            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>To ensure Core Business Process services for one of my clients meet performance standards, I led the development of a real-time service performance monitoring dashboard. By integrating data from ServiceNow and Service Hub, and visualizing it in Power BI, the initiative provided transparent SLA tracking, incident management, and actionable insights for IT and business teams.</p>
            <!--<p>With Windows Server 2012 reaching its End-of-Life, businesses needed a strategic approach to migrate workloads securely and efficiently. I have provided tailored solutions to ensure a seamless transition.</p>-->

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>The project involved consolidating data from multiple ITSM platforms, handling real-time data updates, and ensuring accuracy and consistency in reporting. Another key challenge was designing dashboards that were intuitive for both IT teams and business stakeholders, while providing proactive alerts for potential SLA breaches.</p>

                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                <p>I integrated ServiceNow and Service Hub data into Power BI using APIs, ensuring near real-time updates. Interactive dashboards were created to track incident response times, SLA adherence, service availability, and recurring incident trends. Automated alerts via Power BI and Teams enabled proactive mitigation of SLA risks. I also worked closely with IT and business stakeholders to tailor insights and reporting for informed decision-making.</p>

                <h2>The Results</h2>
                <p>The dashboard improved SLA compliance by 20% within three months and reduced recurring incidents through proactive monitoring. It enhanced transparency for leadership and stakeholders, provided actionable insights for continuous improvement, and contributed to a more reliable and predictable end-user experience across Core Business Process services.</p>
             <!--   <p>The bespoke E2E solution was built from gound up using an 80/20 approach which allowed me to deploy core functionality quickly ina the form of Minimum Viable product (MVP) while avoiding feature creep that often occurs as a result of focussing on edge cases.</p>
                <p>This powerful and varied webapp is easy to access vi an intuitive, user-friendly front end interface. Critically, it has allowed CLIENT to retire 5 seperate SaaS applications, streamlining & simplifying day-to-day operations in one convenient.</p>-->
