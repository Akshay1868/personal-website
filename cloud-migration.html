            <!--<p>My Client is mainly engaged in refining of crude oil. This company provides energy in a safe, respectful and sustainable way by reducing emmissions from it's own operations. This company has a record for processing highest number of oil barrels per day.</p>
            <p>Led the end-to-end cloud migration initiative, ensuring seamless delivery of IT services while transitioning critical business applications from on-premise data centers to AWS. The project aimed to enhance service availability, operational efficiency, and scalability for business-critical systems.</p>-->
            <p>From 2019 to 2022, the client’s applications and backend systems were spread across multiple on-premise data centers. While operationally stable, the setup constrained agility, scalability, and the ability to support business growth.</p>
        <p>As the Service Delivery Lead, I oversaw the migration of <strong>18 applications</strong> to a hybrid cloud environment over two years, ensuring seamless service continuity, stakeholder alignment, and measurable improvements in IT performance.</p>

                <p>"A Cloud migration strategy to transfer workloads and knowledge"</p>
                <p> This migration kicked off in early 2022 with me managing the project to make sure that the various product teams worked together in a cohesive way.</p>
                <p> After about 9 months of preparation, the actual migration completed in a matter of weeks. An intelligent lift and shift approach was adopted making tactical use of AWS Services.
